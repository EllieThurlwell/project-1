-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used across the site are the primary colours red, blue and yellow. The colours of the heading elements are a dark purple colour (#330033) and all other text is a dark green (#001400), both found in the painting Mona Lisa.
    -   #### Typography
        -   Montserrat is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. Montserrat is clean and easy to read, appropriate for a younger target audience. The line spacing applied increases this ease. Gloria Hallelujah is the font for all headings with Cursive as the fallback font. It has fun and childlike characteristics and resembles handwriting, making it appropriate for the subject matter.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is key for the purpose of this website. When initially loaded the main image of Mona Lisa is positioned centrally with no distractions, clearly illustrating the focus of the site. More images appear alongside the relevant text content which provides some visual learning and breaks up the content. 
        -   The paint splatter design of the Discover Art! logo continues throughout the page in the background of all headings. This adds visual consistency and a coherent identity.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers on both desktop and mobile, and Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer on desktop.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices including MacBook, laptop, iPad, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone 12 mini, Samsung Galaxy Note8 and Huawei P20.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site to point out any issues. 
-   Two friends with both art and teaching backgrounds were asked to review the site and responded that the content is relevant and well structured for the intended audience and purpose. 

### Bugs

-   Pages and linked sections begin at the top of the viewport and are therefore hidden behind the fixed header.
    - fixed by creating the section-padding class and setting it's size to clear the header.
-   When completing the form element and clicking the 'Check Answers' button for the first time the site reloads. Any time after this the button correctly displays the modal box.
    - fixed by wrapping the button in a parent div.
-   Image in 'Where Is She?' section becomes distorted on iPad screensize.
    - fixed by moving it's css rule into the media query for the previous size of screen.
-   Positioning of one image and the form are shifted on Internet Explorer. louvre-crowd.jpg is pushed all the way to the right and the fieldsets in the form overlap each other.
    - not fixed - works correct in all other browsers tested.
