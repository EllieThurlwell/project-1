				Mona Lisa is one of the most famous faces in the world! Do you recognise her?
				Mona Lisa is a painting by an Italian artist named Leonardo da Vinci. Over 500 years ago he was asked by Francesco del Giocondo to paint a portrait of his wife Lisa. That’s right, Mona Lisa was a real person! Some people think she never got to see her amazing portrait though. 
				Leonardo worked on the painting for around 4 years. It took so long that he just kept it for himself instead of giving it to Francesco, and carried on making changes to it for the rest of his life. It was his favourite painting he ever made.

				Mona Lisa sits in a chair in front of the viewer. Her face is turned to look at us, as if we were having a conversation. What would you talk to her about? In the background you can see an interesting landscape filled with valleys and rivers. This kind of picture probably looks quite familiar to you, but when Leonardo da Vinci painted it this was very unusual! During the Renaissance - the name given to that period of time - portraits would show the side of the person’s face. Mona Lisa was a new and exciting kind of portrait. 
				Mona Lisa has been an inspiration to lots of people. Other artists and lots of students have made copies of the painting and used her face in their own artworks. You can now see her on all kinds of items and souvenirs like mugs, keyrings and postcards.

			<p>
				Leonardo da Vinci began painting Mona Lisa while he lived in Italy, but a few years before he died he moved to France. When he died the French King Francois I kept Mona Lisa at his palace and she stayed there for 100 years. Another French king, Louis XIV, then moved her to a different palace. When Napoleon was leader of France he liked her so much he kept Mona Lisa in his bedroom!
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Around 200 years ago Mona Lisa was moved to the Louvre museum in Paris. Everything was going great until 1911 when she was stolen! News spread fast and they identified some suspects, one of which was another very famous painter - Pablo Picasso. She was missing for 2 years before they found out what happened. A man working at the museum stole the painting because he thought it should be in Italy and he wanted to take it there. He only spent a few months in jail.

					The theft made Mona Lisa even more famous. Now, 80% of people who go to the Louvre museum go to see Mona Lisa, that's over 6 million people every year! She is kept in a special room behind protective glass so nothing bad can happen to her again.

					Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 in Italy. He is most famous for his paintings, but he had many other talents. He was very interested in nature and wanted to learn how everything worked. He loved science, maths, music, writing and inventing. Some of the ideas he had are now common objects like calculators and parachutes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Leonardo studied things by looking at the world around him. He had notebooks full of drawings and ideas about things he found interesting. He liked anatomy and nature and would often draw detailed pictures of people, horses, dogs and plants. Many of these books are now also in museums.
